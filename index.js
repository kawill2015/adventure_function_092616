/*
	Optional: Create several more types of adventures, weapons, actions, etc.

	Optional: Allow the user to interact with the story more than just clicking
	the "new adventure!" button. You'll need to create variables to keep track
	of state.

	Optional (advanced): Use document.location.hash in a way which allows the
	user to bookmark a specific story that they like and return to it later.
